#2.2 Operators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical
#2.2.1 Arithmetic Operators
#   + Addition
#   - Subtraction
#   * Multiplication
#   / Division
#   % Mod (the remainder after dividing)
#   ** Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
#   // Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer
#Run the following code:

a = 5 + 9
b = 8 - 4
c = 3 * 7
d = 50 / 6
e = 50 % 6
f = 2 ** 4
g = 50 // 6
print(f"a = {a}\nb = {b}\nc = {c}\nd = {d}\ne = {e}\nf = {f}\ng = {g}\n")

#time = 40
# This code demonstrates arithmetic operators.
